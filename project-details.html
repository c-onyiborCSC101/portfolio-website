                <h2>Full Description</h2>
                <p> The Attendance Shift Management System aims to enhance internal operations by automating the attendance and shift
                    managment system for support staff, which includes Security, Horticulture, Facility, Cafeteria, and Maintenance Units.
                    It is a biometric-based sign-in system that improves accountability, streamlines attendance monitoring, and supports shift
                    planning.

                <h2>Problem Solved</h2>
                <p>The Attendance Shift Management System was developed to address critical operational inefficiencies in tracking and managing
                    support staff across five units: Security, Horticulture, Facility, Cafeteria, and Maintenance. Here are some of the inefficiencies
                    it addressed:
                </p>

                <h3>Eliminated Manual & Error-Prone Attendance Tracking</h3>
                <p>Problem: Manual attendance logs were inaccurate, prone to human error, and difficult to verify.
                </p>
                <p>Solution: Automated biometric (fingerprint) sign-in/sign-out with timestamps and email confirmations.</p>

                <h3> Streamlined Shift Management & Accountability</h3>
                <p>Problem: Inefficient manual scheduling, unclear shift assignments, and poor shift swap processes.</p>
                <p>Solution: Digital rosters uploaded by supervisors, automated shift assignment emails, and a structured shift swap request/approval workflow.</p>

                <h3>Improved Security & Access Control</h3>
                <p>Problem: No role-based access; sensitive staff data and management functions were not properly secured.</p>
                <p>Solution: Multi-level user roles (Supervisor, Non-Supervisor, IT Admin, Director) with strict permissions and encrypted password storage.</p>

                <h3>Standardized Unit-Specific Shift Schedules</h3>
                <p>Problem: Inconsistent shift timing across different units caused confusion.</p>
                <p>Solution: Defined shift schedules per unit (Maintenance, Cafeteria, Security, Facility, Horticulture) with clear time boundaries.</p>

                <h3>Simplified Administrative Tasks</h3>
                <p>Problem: IT administrators burdened with manual password resets, account management, and data entry.</p>
                <p>Solution: Automated password generation/reset, bulk roster uploads, and centralized user management interface.</p>
